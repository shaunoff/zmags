The purpose of this small application is to generate 10 random stories from the Hacker-News api.

Using ES7 async/await, the numerous api calls required to collect the data are syntactically concise and readable.

By clicking on the refresh button, you can generate a new set of random stories.

The only additional dependencies are moment for date manipulation and graphene-ui for creating the UI.

Graphene-UI is an open source UI library that I am creating. The documentation can be found here: https://graphene-ui.herokuapp.com/
